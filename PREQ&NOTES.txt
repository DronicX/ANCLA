In Twitter, you can limit search to locales using Yahoo Where on Earth 
unique ids for those locales.
WORLD_WOE_ID = 1
US_WOE_ID = 23424977

API calls like the world place tweets trending call, are rate limited
We can see them in here -> https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/rate-limits.html
 
To check if a Tweet has been retweeted, check if the retweeted_status
node wrapper exists in the tweet you are looking

When getting RT counts, we get the number, but it is possible we didn't
get all the data for those who retweeted said tweet
