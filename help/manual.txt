ANCLA Help:
ANCLA works the following way:
action-specification parameter1 parameter2 ...

An action is a general term such as analyze or search
A specification is a term that specifies the type of action you want
A parameter is an information you give to the action your performing
A action-specification combination determines how many parameters are necesary and which aren't and what they mean.

Let's see an example:
You want to do sentiment analysis on 100 tweets with the words Donald Trump
The code for this would be
analyze-sentiment "Donald Trump" 100
Here we speicify we want an sentiment analysis on 100 tweets with the words Donald Trump

There are different types of parameters. Each action-specification use different ypes of parameters.
These parameter types are:
NUMBER - a number
LINK - a link starts with http:// or https:// followed by the link itself
USER - a twitter username. Must start with @
HASHTAG - a twitter hashtag. Must start with #
EMAIL - an email
STRING - various words for searching. Must be encased by quotation marks
WORD - just a single word without any space. Quotation marks not required

FUNCTIONS:
ANCLA has support for functions.
Functions use the info gathered by some actions and runs a function with that info
It works like this
function(action-specification parameter1 parameter2 ...).variable

As an example, lets say we want to find the average of likes from 100 tweets that contain the string Donald Trump
We use this
average(search-tweets "Donald Trump" 100).likes
Note that having a .variable is optional running this
average(search-tweets "Donald Trump" 100)
runs an average on ALL info returned by search-tweets action
